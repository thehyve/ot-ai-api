# Open Targets AI API

This repository holds the Open Targets AI API router.

For this API to function an .env file has to be added in the root folder of this project. For the values of these variables please contact the Open Targets team of The Hyve or create your own Azure OpenAI deployment.

### .env variables
```
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT = ...
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY = ...
AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME = ...
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION = ...
AZURE_OPENAI_API_INSTANCE_NAME = ...
MAX_LLM_REQUESTS = ...

SERVER_NAME = ...
```

### Required stack

```

### Running development

$ npm run dev
```

### Running local build

### Building production-ready bundle with docker

Build your image:

```
$ docker build . -t <your username>/ot-ai-api
```

Run your image:
For running the image you need to map the port to whatever you wish to use on your host. In this example, we simply map port 49160 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker.

Youl will also need to provide your own OpenAI key via the environment variable `OPENAI_TOKEN`.

```
$ docker run -p 49160:8080 -e "OPENAI_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXX" -d <your username>/ot-ai-api
```
